# Bugarium

### Intro

This is a codebase of [bugs.shpp.me](https://bugs.shpp.me) project, made by [ле++](https://programming.kr.ua) Programming School.
The purpose is to allow users to support School: buy the bug-artwork. All the received money are spent on social things, or at least to cover the rent and utilities :)
  

The project is based on [gopherize.me](https://gopherize.me/) idea.
